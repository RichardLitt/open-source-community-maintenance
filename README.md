## Table of Contents

## Introduction

### What is this thing

This is a list of notes, tools, and resources for how to run an open source community-based project on GitHub, today.

...

## Chapter 1: Read the thing that says "README"

Your README file is generally the go-to document for people to understand, install, use and interact with your module. Standardizing how your README files are written ensure that they have all the elements necessary for people to easily understand and engage with your module. By using a Standard README format, the process of creating and maintaining accurate and well-written documentation that describes what your module is for, how it can be installed, how it is used, and any other relevant details, will be far easier for you.

## Chapter 7: Edit your package, Jason

TK More on these, here: docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json

#### `authors`

The "author" field in a package.json file indicates the person who wrote the package, allowing the publisher to share the author's name, email, and url. The "author" field gives credit to the person for writing the package and shares their contact information for people to contact, or learn more about, the author and their projects.

## Install / Usage

This is a documentation-only repository. There's nothing to install. There's nothing to run. Just read, for now.

## Contribute

This project is very much a work in progress WIP. Feel free to contribute by opening issues, or, even better, pull requests. Any and all help would be appreciated.
